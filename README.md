# P1NG by SkyLife
## By Daniel Handojo, UCSB Hackathon Participant
The inspiration for doing this application was the desire to share cartoon enjoyment on a larger scale. P1NG is a social experience-sharing application that hopes to be more than any other application on the market without taking itself too seriously. Users can create and customize their avatar, their orbs, and their throws, then share those concerted efforts with anyone using wifi-direct. In other words, P1NG was born to be fun for the programmer and the users.

> Yeah, launch that ball at your friend's head!

Initially, it started as a humorous idea proposed to my friend when we were considering long-term project ideas, but it always seemed to have potential, mainly because it can be reinvented into many different interpretations. One could use thermal imaging to add special effects to throws or location apis to consider what a campus would do to the trajectory of a random toss. The drone could even be a special "live" throw that targets the recipient through location tracking in nearby areas. The target user for this application is anyone who can appreciate simple humor and silly innovation which, along with the graphics, skews the target age range towards the younger audience. 

I am most proud of the application's ability to track finger touches and send similar data to other androids. It was a hectic and wonderful experience and, as this application's function is simple, it can be innovated through the use of other apis to do things unimaginable, just as the basic features of the application were once thought unimaginable. It was difficult work, but worth the patience, and official release should be a possibility in the coming Sunday. Until the next release. This work is released under the MIT license.

> It's satisfying, as in to do it back to them, like poking is.
